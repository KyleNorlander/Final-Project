# Final-Project
Repository for final project (End of the World Game Jam) for Game Technology


FOR THIS GAME, we have created a map containing three sections: main house,
	forrest, and bunker. We used available pre-made assets and code from
	online sources and past projects as a basis. We then created some new
	assets and code for the specifics of this game. We updated the 
	landscape of the world and made the area appear dark and spooky.

	The character moves using WASD & Space for jump, as well as the mouse
	for turning. We gave them a flashlight and an adjustable run speed
	based on damage taken.


TITLE:		END OF THE LINE

OBJECTIVE:	Upon waking up to the end of the world, your character must
		make their way through obstacles and enemies, find the key
		to the fuse box, turn on the power, and enter the bunker to
		stay alive. 
		
		For every hit from an enemy, your character loses speed, thus
		causing a win condition to be further and further from your
		grasp.

		If you are hit three times, your character dies.
